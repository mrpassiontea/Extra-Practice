# Extra Practice

## Overview

Extra Practice is a powerful userscript that allows you to create custom practice sessions for radicals and kanji at your current WaniKani level. I wanted to study the radicals and kanji at my current level but couldn't find anything that met my needs. This tool helps you reinforce your learning by providing focused, flexible review opportunities.
