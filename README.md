# WaniKani Extra Practice

## Overview

WaniKani Extra Practice is a powerful userscript that allows you to create custom practice sessions for radicals and kanji at your current WaniKani level. I found myself wanting to specifically study the radicals and kanji at my current level but didn't find anything that met my needs. This tool helps you reinforce your learning by providing focused, flexible review opportunities.

## Features

- Practice Radicals and Kanji from your current level
- Randomized review order
- Custom selection of items to review
- Hint and explanation system

   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)

2. Click "Raw" on the script file or copy the entire script
